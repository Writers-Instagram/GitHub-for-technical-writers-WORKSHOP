## Glossary

- GitHub: Instagram for developers
- Repository: like an instagram profile with fancy stuff (you can have many profiles sic! :D)
- Clone: Copy sb's repo (profile) to work on it locally
- Fork: Kind of cloning with the assumption to contribute to an existing repo (you can add your pictures to somebody's profile) or to extend it separately
- Pull Request: A request sent to the profile owner to make the pictures you added to their profile visible to all
- Branches: Different versions of the profile with extra photos, changes, work in progress
- Commit: Saving changes
- Push/Pull: Send or download the changes to local version
- Local vs Remote: On your machine / on a server
- Merge: Combine different branches in one
- Merge Conflict: RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!

## GitHub online editing vs local editing

This workshop is fully based on GitHub functionality, to show that Git clients usage is needed only in case of advance users.

Git is a distributet version control system. In human words: A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

No GitHub? Are you using Bitbucket?
- [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Easy to start with thanks to this free training https://try.github.io
- https://desktop.github.com/
- https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/

Stick to the tool that your team mates use.

- https://travis-ci.org
- https://circleci.com/

1. Enable Travis to gain access to your repository: https://travis-ci.org/profile/
2. Create such [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) file in the root of your repository
3. Check how is your CI plan doing: https://travis-ci.org/profile-org-name/repo-name
4. Add a badge to the top of the README:
```

```

## [Optional] Project management through Project and Issues

Define a Project and start working with Issues to assure transparency of your project for the community. Define your own [issue template](https://github.com/YaaS/chewie/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) to make issue reporting much easier and assure you're getting all important data immediately from the user
