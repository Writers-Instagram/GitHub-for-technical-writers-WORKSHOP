  https://honza.ca/2011/03/7-ways-github-has-changed-the-open-source-world
  This post was published exactly when the GitHub populatiry started rising. It is still valid. 
  GitHub didn't change only developers lives, but also technical writers lives:
  - Static site generators
  - Markdown popularity
  - Readme driven development
  - Overall awareness of how important it is to have a good documentation quality

## Glossary (MS)

- GitHub: Instagram for developers
- Repository: like an instagram profile with fancy stuff (you can have many profiles sic! :D)
- Clone: Copy sb's repo (profile) to work on it locally
- Fork: Kind of cloning with the assumption to contribute to an existing repo (you can add your pictures to somebody's profile) or to extend it separately
- Pull Request: A request sent to the profile owner to make the pictures you added to their profile visible to all
- Branches: Different versions of the profile with extra photos, changes, work in progress
- Commit: Saving changes
- Push/Pull: Send or download the changes to local version
- Local vs Remote: On your machine / on a server
- Merge: Combine different branches in one
- Merge Conflict: RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!

## GitHub online editing vs local editing (LG)

This workshop is fully based on GitHub functionality, to show that Git clients usage is needed only in case of advance users.

Git is a distributed version control system. In human words: A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

No GitHub? Are you using Bitbucket?
- [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Easy to start with thanks to this free training https://try.github.io
- https://desktop.github.com/
- https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/

Stick to the tool that your team mates use.
