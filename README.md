### Crowd sourcing 

- what CS is?
- Through edit buttons in UI, show sample https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-configuration/

TODO: check how we could use Gitter or some other geeky communicator to get people on board quickly and make them share links to their repos easily

### Markdown + GitHub Flavoured Markdown

- what markdown is
- show samples, provide links to good learning materials
- explain GFM term

### What approaches to writing docu in repos are

- Simple docu, readme only
- Readme -> Readme with links to more docs 
- Wiki 
- Jekyll site

### [Optional] GitHub Pages + Jekyll

Have sample + instructions that are easy to follow to publish simple static web page with docu

### [Optional] Project management through Project and Issues

- Base whole work on samples or script on project management feature
- Create incidents for each change and collaborate through all github feature

Later we can show to audience what were the benefits. We will ask them to plan some project and create some issues maybe?

### [Optional] Automation, Travis, links validation

Have sample + instructions that are easy to follow to set up continuous integration that is validating if links are working in documentation
