## Glossary

- GitHub: Instagram for developers
- Repository: like an instagram profile with fancy stuff (you can have many profiles sic! :D)
- Clone: Copy sb's repo (profile) to work on it locally
- Fork: Kind of cloning with the assumption to contribute to an existing repo (you can add your pictures to somebody's profile) or to extend it separately
- Pull Request: A request sent to the profile owner to make the pictures you added to their profile visible to all
- Branches: Different versions of the profile with extra photos, changes, work in progress
- Commit: Saving changes
- Push/Pull: Send or download the changes to local version
- Local vs Remote: On your machine / on a server
- Merge: Combine different branches in one
- Merge Conflict: RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!

### GitHub online editing vs git

This workshop is fully based on GitHub functionality, to show that Git clients usage is needed only in case of advance users.

Git is a distributet version control system. In human words: A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

No GitHub? you use Bitbucket?
- [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Easy to start with thatnks to this free training https://try.github.io
- https://desktop.github.com/
- https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
Stick to the tool that your team mates use.

### Contribution flows

- as project member
- through forks

### Crowd sourcing 

- what CS is?
- Through edit buttons in UI, show sample https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-configuration/
- Make participants provide such edit links to others during the workshop and do crowd sourcing

TODO: check how we could use Gitter or some other geeky communicator to get people on board quickly and make them share links to their repos easily :white_check_mark:
- to use Gitter you need a GitHub account or a Twitter account
- we have a room created: https://gitter.im/Writers-Instagram/Writers-Instagram?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link or we can use the Lobby chat room https://gitter.im/Writers-Instagram/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link

### Markdown + GitHub Flavoured Markdown

- what markdown is
- show samples, provide links to good learning materials (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax, https://dillinger.io/)
- explain GFM term

### What approaches to writing docu in repos are

- Simple docu, readme only
- Readme -> Readme with links to more docs 
- Wiki 
- Jekyll site

### [Optional] GitHub Pages + Jekyll

Have sample + instructions that are easy to follow to publish simple static web page with docu

### [Optional] Project management through Project and Issues

- Base whole work on samples or script on project management feature
- Create incidents for each change and collaborate through all github feature

Later we can show to audience what were the benefits. We will ask them to plan some project and create some issues maybe?

### [Optional] Automation, Travis, links validation

Have sample + instructions that are easy to follow to set up continuous integration that is validating if links are working in documentation

### [Optional] Gist?
