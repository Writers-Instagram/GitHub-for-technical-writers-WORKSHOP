## Main assumptions

Sample data should be based on dummy lorem ipsum content like https://hipsum.co/?paras=5&type=hipster-latin


## Script Draft

### Why GitHub

- Who uses it?
- What GitHub changed in the It world
- What are the benefits?
- What people use it for (not only code, but writing books for example)

### Glossary

- GitHub - Instagram for developers
- Repository - like an instagram profile with fancy stuff (you can have many profiles sic! :D)
- Clone - copy sb's repo (profile) to work on it locally
- Fork - kind of cloning with the assumption to contribute to an existing repo (you can add your pictures to somebody's profile)
- Pull Request - a request sent to the profile owner to make the pictures you added to their profile visible to all
- Branches - copies of sb's profile with extra photos, changes
- Commit - information about changes made to sb's repo
- Push/Pull - send or download the changes made
- Local vs Remote - on your machine / on a server

### GitHub online editing vs git

- Explain that workshop is based on GitHub online editor.
- Explain what git is and what is has to do with GitHub
- What tools to use for git if we do not have a luxury to use GitHub in corporate organization

### Contribution flows

- as project member
- through forks

### Crowd sourcing 

- what CS is?
- Through edit buttons in UI, show sample https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/object-management-kubectl/imperative-object-management-configuration/
- Make participants provide such edit links to others during the workshop and do crowd sourcing

TODO: check how we could use Gitter or some other geeky communicator to get people on board quickly and make them share links to their repos easily :white_check_mark:
- to use Gitter you need a GitHub account or a Twitter account
- we have a room created: https://gitter.im/Writers-Instagram/Writers-Instagram?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link or we can use the Lobby chat room https://gitter.im/Writers-Instagram/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link

### Markdown + GitHub Flavoured Markdown

- what markdown is
- show samples, provide links to good learning materials (https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax, https://dillinger.io/)
- explain GFM term

### What approaches to writing docu in repos are

- Simple docu, readme only
- Readme -> Readme with links to more docs 
- Wiki 
- Jekyll site

### [Optional] GitHub Pages + Jekyll

Have sample + instructions that are easy to follow to publish simple static web page with docu

### [Optional] Project management through Project and Issues

- Base whole work on samples or script on project management feature
- Create incidents for each change and collaborate through all github feature

Later we can show to audience what were the benefits. We will ask them to plan some project and create some issues maybe?

### [Optional] Automation, Travis, links validation

Have sample + instructions that are easy to follow to set up continuous integration that is validating if links are working in documentation

### [Optional] Gist?
