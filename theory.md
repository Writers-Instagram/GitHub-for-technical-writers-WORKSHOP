## Glossary

- GitHub: Instagram for developers
- Repository: An instagram profile with fancy stuff (you can have many profiles sic! :D)
- Clone: Copy sb's repo (profile) to work on it locally
- Fork: Kind of clone with the assumption to contribute to an existing repo (you can add your pictures to somebody's profile) or to extend it separately
- Pull Request: A request sent to the profile owner to make the pictures you added to their profile visible to all
- Branches: Different versions of a profile with extra photos, changes, work in progress
- Commit: Save changes
- Local vs. Remote: On your machine / on a server
- Push/Pull: Send the changes you made on your local version to the server / download sb else's the changes from the server to your local version
- Merge: Combine different branches in one
- Merge Conflict: RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!

## GitHub online editing vs. local editing

This workshop is fully based on GitHub functionality, to show that Git clients usage is needed only in case of advance users.

Git is a distributed version control system. In human words: A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

No GitHub? Do you use Bitbucket?
- [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Easy to start with thanks to this free training https://try.github.io
- https://desktop.github.com/

Stick to the tool that your team mates use.

## Contribution flows

Basic workflow:
1. Create a repository
2. Create a 'feature' branch from the 'master' 
3. Make and commit your changes
4. Open a pull request
5. Merge the pull request into the 'master'


- Project member:
  - Edit -> Commit
  - **Clone repo** -> **Create branch** -> Edit -> Commit -> **Open pull request**
- Project non-member: **Fork** repo -> Create branch -> Edit -> Commit -> Open pull request
