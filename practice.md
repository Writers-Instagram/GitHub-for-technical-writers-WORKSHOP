## Contribution with pull requests

1. Go to [play-bucket](https://github.com/Writers-Instagram/play-bucket) repository
1. Suggest new file creation or change in some existing file. Make a change and propose a pull request, so it can be accepted and merged.

Advanced: now let us simulate a merge conflict :wink:

## Create own repository with README with external links

1. Create new repository in your GitHub profile: https://github.com/{your-profile-name}?tab=repositories
1. Create few markdown files, including README.md. You can use https://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum/ to generate the content.
1. Link those docs one to another. Broken links are very welcome because of next sections of the script.

## GitHub Pages

1. Go to settings tab of your repository. In **GitHub Pages** section enable them and choose the theme you like the most

Take a look on example GitHub Page enabled for this script: https://writers-instagram.github.io/GitHub-for-technical-writers-WORKSHOP/
