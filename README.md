TODO: check how we could use Gitter or some other geeky communicator to get people on board quickly and make them share links to their repos easily :white_check_mark:
- to use Gitter you need a GitHub account or a Twitter account
- we have a room created: https://gitter.im/Writers-Instagram/Writers-Instagram?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link or we can use the Lobby chat room https://gitter.im/Writers-Instagram/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link

### [Optional] Project management through Project and Issues
